### How Algorithms Came to Rule Our World
People all over the world have realized that big companies understand us better and better gradually.  They recommand some Italian restaurants we're likely to have dinner this evening, they show us what we gonna buy whenever we log in Amazon, they addict us by pushing so many interesting but meaningless news to our mobile. We know they know us well, and we may also know the terms behind those magic are algorithms. including math, analysis, artificial intelligence, etc.. Being comfortable with the situation that those techniques bring us so much convenience, we are lazy to explore the world far from us which is ruled by algorithms.
Recently, I read a book: How Algorithms Came to Rule Our World, authored by Christopher Steiner. I am shocked by almost all the stories and views.

#### Silicon Valley and Wall Street

At present, software engineers are all dreamed of entering big Silicon Valley comanies like google because of the salary packages and the probability of changing the world, often the changing-world-issue was born with the software career. What we may not know is, in the past, Silicon Valley companies were hard to compete with Wall Street, because of dissimilar salary packages. It's true. Wall Street firms hired more and more best software engineers to try to dominate the market or to not fall behind. The whole bizarre thing comes from the story of [Thomas Peterffy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Peterffy), who is a pioneer of using algorithms to defeat human.  

Thomas Peterffy is a programmer of Wall Street, and he found a tricky solution to operater stocks, using computer faster and preciser than human stocker to calculate the stocks. He became a billionaire and what he had done opened a gate for Wall Street, as a result, more and more firms recruited excellent software engineers, from quantity to quality. Algorithms and software engineers were the key point of Wall Street. As the time went on, algorithms themselves met bottlenecks and Wall Street companies started investigated more on hardware to support the algorithms, like the network bandwidth. In conclusion, algorithm rules Wall Street.

#### Music 
If you search [David Cope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cope), the results may blow your mind. If you don't, you may never know there's a machine which have created so many songs, and those songs are good enough that you may think they are better than human made songs.  

……

Nowadays, so many awesome products using algorithms behind have come into our lives, like Google Search and Youtube, and software engineers behind algorithms play a key role in current world. They're changing the world, just as what they have always been dreamed of.
