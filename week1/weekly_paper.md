Itâ€™s an astonishing news that a google brain team is learning how to program. From the paper NEURAL NETWORKS FOR MODELING SOURCE CODE EDITS on arXiv https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.02818.pdf. In the paper, the team treats source code of software developers modify as a dynamic object and model the modifying developers do to the source code files, and the team also proposed two edits representations: explicit and implicit representations. They developed models of edit sequences to learning from past edits and predict future edits, and they believe edit histories contain significant useful information and will help us more in learning how to program.
